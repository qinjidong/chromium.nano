# Chrome Enterprise Companion

Chrome Enterprise Companion (CEC) is an elevated daemon for MacOS and Windows
that handles the enterprise device management features which are not feasible to
implement in browser.

The mission of CEC is to empower development of client-side enterprise features
and reduce complexity by decoupling enterprise functionality from the updater
client.
